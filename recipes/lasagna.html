        <li> 1/2 lb. ground beef</li>
        <li>1 lb. hot breakfast sausage</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced
        <li>2 (14.5-oz.) cans whole tomatoes
        <li>2 (6-oz.) cans tomato paste
        <li>4 Tbsp. dried parsley, divided
        <li>2 Tbsp. dried basil
        <li>2 1/2 tsp. salt
        <li>3 cups low-fat cottage cheese</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated (not shredded) parmesan cheese
        <li>1 Tbsp. olive oil
        <li>1 (1o-oz.) package lasagna noodles
        <li> lb. sliced mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet or saucepan, combine ground beef, sausage, and garlic. Cook over medium-high heat until browned. Drain half the fat; less if you’re feeling naughty. Add tomatoes, tomato paste, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil and 1 teaspoon salt. After adding the tomatoes, the sauce mixture should simmer for 45 minutes while you are working on the other steps.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, mix cottage cheese, beaten eggs, grated Parmesan, 2 more tablespoons parsley, and 1 more teaspoon salt. Stir together well. Set aside. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and the olive oil to the boiling water, then cook the lasagna noodles until al dente (not overly cooked). Drain.</li>
        <li>To assemble: Arrange 4 cooked lasagna noodles in the bottom of a baking pan, overlapping if necessary. Spoon half the cottage cheese mixture over the noodles. Spread evenly. Cover cottage cheese with a layer of mozzarella cheese. Spoon a little less than half the meat/sauce mixture over the top. Repeat, ending with meat/sauce mixture. Sprinkle top generously with extra Parmesan.</li>
        <li>Either freeze, refrigerate for up to 2 days, or bake immediately: 350°F oven until the top is hot and bubbly, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
